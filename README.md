## What is mfetch?

**mfetch** is a lightweight, clean and fast command-line system information tool written in `bash 3.2+`.  
It is a fork of [Neofetch](https://github.com/dylanaraps/neofetch), simplified and optimized for aesthetic screenshots and minimal system overhead.

Use it to display your system's OS, hardware, DE, terminal, memory, and more — all in a visually pleasing format.
