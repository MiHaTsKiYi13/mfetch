**mfetch** is a minimalist and aesthetic command-line system information tool written in pure `bash 3.2+`. It is a fork of Neofetch, modified with a focus on performance, simplicity, and visual appeal.

Designed for users who want a clean and informative terminal output, mfetch presents essential system details in a compact and configurable format. Whether you want to showcase your setup in screenshots or simply check system stats, mfetch provides the most relevant information in a visually pleasing way.

### Features

- Fast, lightweight, and dependency-free
- Easily configurable through flags or a config file
- Displays key system information: OS, DE, GPU, RAM, kernel, uptime, and more
- Supports ASCII logos, images, or plain text output
- Cross-platform: works on Linux, macOS, Android (Termux), and others

### Purpose

mfetch is intended for use in terminal screenshots or quick system overviews. It is not designed to replace full diagnostic tools like `htop`, `inxi`, or `glances`, but rather to complement them with concise and stylish output.

### Supported Operating Systems

mfetch supports over 150 operating systems, including common distributions like Arch Linux, Debian, Fedora, and more obscure systems such as Haiku, Minix, and AIX. If your system is not supported, you can open an issue to request support.
